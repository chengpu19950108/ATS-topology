Run the file <main.m> in matlab, then  select the file <2D_FORCE.k> as the input file.

ATTENTION: Ls-dyna (A solver of finite element method) is needed for this program, and this software
           is installed in 'F:\ls-dyna\program\ls-dyna_smp_s_R700_winx64_ifort101.exe'. If yours is 
           installed in other path, then the code in line 60 of '+lsdyna\simulation.m' should be 
           accordingly changed.
