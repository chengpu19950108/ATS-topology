# ATS-topology
Codes and necessary FE model for ATS topology optimization method.

The file folder 'iteration_images' is the iteration results of this methods, you can also run the file 'ATS_topology/main.m' to get these images. 

The file '2D_FORCE.k' is the FE model used in this numerical example.

Software needed:
(1) Matlab
(2) Ls-dyna (installed in  'F:\ls-dyna\program\ls-dyna_smp_s_R700_winx64_ifort101.exe' in this example)

Attention 1: The ATS-topology is used for the optimization of connection joints, the two parts of the joints are numbered as 1 and 2. The codes illustrated here can only be used for this example here. When applicated in other examples, the FE model and some parameters here should be corrected according to the theory.

Attention 2: in this example, two completely overlapping grids are used to construct parts 1 and 2, which is to facilitate the updating of design variables, and ensure the reasonable grid consecutivenessand edge conditions.
